The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern aims to assign each class a particular
job.  The job is given by a handler interface.  Each class signals the proceeding
class to do it's job after the current class is done.  In some cases like in
math.py, the chain of responsibility is executed until a particular job is found
and executed whereas in atm.py each class performs a task until all objects are done
executing.
