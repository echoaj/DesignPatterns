The definition of the iterator design pattern is that it allows
for the sequential traversal through a complex data structure
without exposing its internal details.

The iterator design pattern is mostly implemented in languages like
java and c++.  In python they already have a __next__ and __iter__
for creating your own iterator classes.  Plus they already have
generators.
