The idea of the observer design pattern is to update multiple classes
or objects when a subject or one of its attributes has changed.

For example a youtube channel should notify all of its subscribers
when a new video is posted.

This design pattern consists of observers and a subject.  In this case,
The youtube channel would be the subject and the subscribers would
be the observers.

I also made another program that converts a decimal to hexadecimal,
octal, and binary.  In that case, the decimal class is the subject
and the hex, oct, and bin classes are the observers waiting
for the decimal's convert function to update.
