The adapter design pattern allows for 2 interfaces to work together.
Ane example is lets say you have a samsung tv interacting with a sony tv.
They both have similar interfaces with each other, menu, settings ect..
If we wanted to build one library with 1 implementation for each we
could do that using the adapter design pattern, other wise we would
have to create two libraries for the two tvs.
